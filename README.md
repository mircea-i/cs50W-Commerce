# cs50W-Commerce

This is my take on **cs50w - Commerce (project 2)** [requirements here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/)

It requires the implementation of a auctions-like application in Django. The aplication has multiple design requirements:

 - at least three [Django models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/models/) need to be used
 - the login/logout functionality is already provided to you
 - users must be able to create new listings
 - the default route should let you see all the active listings
 - logged in users can add/remove listings to/from their watchlist
 - listings should be grouped into categories
 - on the listing page you should be able to bid and end the auction if you are the original owner.

Also the data needs to be accesible via the [Django admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/) interface.
